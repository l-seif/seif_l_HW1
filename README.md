Situ &amp; I. About us.



BASIC DETAILS!

~ My full name is Laila 'Fadi' Seif. It means in arabic orgin Night 'Redeemer' Sword!
~ My background is (in rough numbers): 50% Palestinian, 25% Lebanese, 25% Syrian... though that is what I mainly am, my great grandma was turkish, so I call my grandma "Anna".
~ 19 years old. May 22, 2005.



MY FEARS!
~ I am horrified of the pitch black or the erry lighting in horror movies where you see but not enough to make it out.
~ Disfiguration (especially in a demonic sence)
~ Jumpscares. Whatever it is may not be scary, but ot jumping at me is enough for me to flip out.



HOBBIES!

~ Another part of me is I have always been into the arts. Other than proforming arts, excluding a tiny bit of music back then (Alto Saxophone, ukulele... sadly may have loss some skill since it was so long ago). Others;
    - Sketch/draw traditionally + digitally
    - Design using Adobe softwares sweep, Canva and Photopea
    - Sew, have created sweaters, clown Halloween costume, pet pillows, etc.
    - Pottery back then when I was young teen
    - Painting, mainly of birds and nature once in a while when I get a sudden urge
    - Photography + videography, mainly while I was running yearbook as Student Rep and for various school events/community acts

~ I love baking and cooking. I even have my own recipes such as Turkish Tiramisu (classic tiramisu with Turkish Coffee), Classic Cheesecake with a honey crust, and Maple Banana Bread.

~ I normally clean and organize a lot! I'm know at work (Storybook Gardens, I am a Building Attendant and Amenities Team Lead) to know where everything goes because I moved it there.

MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND SKILLS!

~ Going into my path of design:
    - I have worked with clients before during grade 11 co-op, and quite a few have used my work. i.e. "Women Rock for Men's Mental Health".
    - London South Collegiate's 100th year anniversary front sign redesign (saved it from the Alumni's version... they broke every design rule there could have been)
    - Used to be the Yearbook Student Rep for two years running. Sadly, my part of the work and more was put in but majority of members and teachers did not do the same, so in both years it fell apart.

 ~ Hardships
    - I have gone through varying challenges in my life. Going from mental/physical health/injury to building up failing grades to straight +95% student through 13 years. I struggles with communication, socializing and being confident. With help from great people, I gotten much better at all of these skills. I am very happy from where these hardships brought me to and don't regret a single thing.
